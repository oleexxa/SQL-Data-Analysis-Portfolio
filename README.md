# Pet Store Sales Analysis (SQL)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to process and analyze retail data using SQL. I focus on extracting actionable business insights from a database of pet store transactions.

## Objectives
* Create and structure a relational database table.
* Filter products based on specific business criteria (pricing, categories).
* Identify high-value inventory items for marketing purposes.

## SQL Techniques Used
* **Data Definition (DDL):** `CREATE TABLE` to define the schema.
* **Data Manipulation (DML):** `INSERT INTO` to populate the dataset.
* **Data Querying:** `SELECT`, `WHERE` clauses, and logical operators (`AND`, `>`).

## Key Insights
By running these queries, I identified:
1. **Premium Segment:** Products in the 'Accessories' category priced above 100 PLN.
2. **Stock Distribution:** The balance between 'Food' and 'Accessories' in the inventory.

## How to Run
1. Execute `01_create_tables.sql` first to set up the database schema and populate it with data.
2. Execute `02_data_analysis.sql` to run the business queries and see the results.
